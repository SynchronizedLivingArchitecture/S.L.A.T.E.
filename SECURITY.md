# Security Policy

## S.L.A.T.E. Security Model

S.L.A.T.E. (Synchronized Living Architecture for Transformation and Evolution) operates with a **LOCAL-ONLY** security model. All AI inference, data processing, and agent operations occur exclusively on localhost (127.0.0.1).

### Security Principles

1. **No External Network Access**: SLATE never makes outbound network calls to cloud AI providers
2. **Trusted Publisher Only**: All Python packages must come from verified publishers (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Anthropic, Meta, Google, HuggingFace)
3. **ActionGuard Protection**: All agent actions are validated before execution
4. **IP Binding**: All servers bind to 127.0.0.1 only - never 0.0.0.0

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.4.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.2.x   | :x:                |
| < 2.2   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/SynchronizedLivingArchitecture/S.L.A.T.E./security/advisories/new)
2. Email: security@synchronizedliving.dev (if available)

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 7 days
- **Fix (Critical)**: Within 14 days
- **Fix (High)**: Within 30 days
- **Fix (Medium/Low)**: Next release cycle

## Fork Security Requirements

All forks that wish to contribute back to SLATE must pass:

1. **CodeQL Security Scan**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
2. **SDK Source Guard Validation**: All packages from trusted publishers
3. **SLATE Prerequisites Check**: All core modules must pass validation
4. **ActionGuard Compliance**: No bypassed security checks

### Automated Fork Validation

When you open a PR from a fork:

```
✅ CodeQL Advanced - Security scan
✅ Python application - Unit tests
✅ SLATE Integration - System validation
✅ SDK Source Guard - Package verification
✅ ActionGuard Audit - Security policy compliance
```

All checks must pass before review.

## Security Features

### ActionGuard (`aurora_core/action_guard.py`)
- Validates all agent actions before execution
- Blocks dangerous operations (rm -rf, format, etc.)
- Rate limits API calls
- Logs all security decisions

### SDK Source Guard (`aurora_core/sdk_source_guard.py`)
- Validates package publishers
- Blocks typosquatting packages
- Enforces trusted sources only

### Content Security Policy
- No external CDN resources
- No external fonts
- All assets bundled locally

## Security Scanning

SLATE uses multiple security scanning tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| CodeQL | Code vulnerability scanning | Active |
| Dependabot | Dependency updates | Active |
| DevSkim | Security linting | Active |
| Defender for DevOps | Supply chain security | Active |
| PSScriptAnalyzer | PowerShell security | Active |
