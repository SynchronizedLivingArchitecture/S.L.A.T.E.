# S.L.A.T.E. Wiki

Welcome to the **S.L.A.T.E.** (Synchronized Living Architecture for Transformation and Evolution) documentation wiki.

## What is SLATE?

SLATE is a local-first AI agent orchestration framework that:

- Coordinates multiple AI models (Ollama, Foundry Local, external APIs)
- Runs entirely on your machine - no cloud dependencies
- Automatically optimizes for your hardware (GPU/CPU)
- Manages complex multi-step workflows

## Key Concepts

### Local-First
All SLATE services bind to `127.0.0.1`. Your code, prompts, and data never leave your machine.

### Multi-Agent Architecture
SLATE uses specialized agents for different tasks:
- **ALPHA**: Code generation and implementation
- **BETA**: Testing and validation
- **GAMMA**: Planning and research
- **DELTA**: External integrations

### Hardware Optimization
SLATE auto-detects your hardware and configures:
- PyTorch settings (TF32, BF16, Flash Attention)
- GPU memory allocation
- Model selection based on VRAM
